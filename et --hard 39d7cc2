    Enhance UserController with secure and role-based endpoints for user and event management
    
    - POST /user/register
      - Registers a new user with username, email, password, and role
      - Password encoding to be implemented in service layer
    
    - POST /user/login
      - Authenticates user credentials (email, password, role)
      - Generates JWT token on successful authentication
    
    - PUT /user/update/{id}
      - Updates personal user profile information (username, email) by user ID
      - Role remains unchanged during update
      - Secured to allow only updates on the current userâ€™s profile
    
    - POST /user/rsvp/{userId}/{eventId}
      - Allows a user with role USER to RSVP to a specific event by IDs
      - Validates the user and event existence via service layer
      - Delegates RSVP processing to EventService ensuring RSVP logic and capacity checks
      - Returns confirmation message with the eventâ€™s name upon successful RSVP
      - Secured with @PreAuthorize to restrict access to authenticated users with USER role
    
    - GET /user/search
      - Placeholder endpoint for searching events by optional date and category parameters
      - Prepared for future integration with EventServiceâ€™s search functionality
    
    These updates improve security, clarity, and functionality of user-event interactions, ensuring only authorized users can RSVP to events while maintaining standard user management features.

    Enhance Events and Admin controllers with explicit user IDs and role-based access control
    
    - Added user/admin/host IDs in URL paths for create, update, delete actions to clearly identify action performers
    - Implemented role checks to restrict access to event management endpoints based on user roles (ADMIN, HOST, USER)
    - Added validation to ensure only users with appropriate roles can perform actions and view related data
    - Improved logging of admin actions for better auditability
    - Structured endpoint URLs to clarify which user is performing the action for better traceability
    - Noted that static Basic Auth credentials are used in Postman: all users under USER role share the same username/password, similarly for ADMIN and HOST roles
